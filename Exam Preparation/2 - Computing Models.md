### Computing Models

* Transformational model - A program starts and finished, transforming input data in output results
* Reactive model - A program executes indefinitely a sequence of interactions, operating over a continuous input data stream
* **Real time model** - Reactive model in which the output stream has to be synchronized with the input data stream, thus imposing time constraints on the program execution.

* Determinism - Feeding a program with the same sequence of data inputs originates the same sequence of data outputs
* Predictability - Feeding a program with the same input sequence will generate the same output sequencce with a **known delay** or within a **known time window**
