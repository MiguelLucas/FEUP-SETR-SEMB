# Real Time Systems

Real time expresses the dependency of a computing system with respect to time as imposed by a physical or logical external process.
A real time system is able to keep the pace of a process and influence it in a desired way. The most important aspects of a real time system are 
* Execution time of the components
  * Code Structure
  * Operating System or kernel
  * DMA, caches, instructions pipeline
* Response time and regularity of generating periodic events
  * Multi-tasking
  * Acess to shared resources
  * Hardware interrupts
*
